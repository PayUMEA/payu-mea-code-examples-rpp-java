This package is mostly generated from a wsdl specified in the pom file. 
To regenerate the client stubs:
 - check the wsdl property in the pom file - this currently points to staging. 
     if you wish to change it, the values in TestClient.java may need to change
 - right click project in eclipse, select run as -> maven-generate-sources
 - check the sources are generated in source directory src/generated/java
 - update classes in src/main/java to do your bidding as you feel fit. 
     these classes are not autogenerated. Ummm.. ApiVersion?? no clue why that didn't generate.
